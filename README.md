# How to get STAIR Actions V1.0

We provide a download script for STAIR Actions `download.sh`, which enables you to download both STAIR Actions (C) and (Y) at one time.
**We highly recommend that you will run the script on a storage with over 1TB space.**

**The download script uses the crawler included in [ActivityNet repository](https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet) to get YouTube videos.
To run the crawler, you need to construct python environment, following this [README](https://github.com/activitynet/ActivityNet/blob/master/Crawler/Kinetics/README.md).
Additionally, you need to install git, [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) in advance to run the download script.**

After the construction of the enviromnent, 
you can download STAIR Actions by just executing the following command.
```
$ bash download.sh
```
It will takes a few days until the end of the execution. 
Finally, STAIR Actions will be created in `STAIR_Actions_[version]/` directory, where [version] is the version number of STAIR Actions to be downloaded.
Note that some video clips will not be generated because some YouTube videos cannot be downloaded ater constructing this dataset.
